His employees are considerate, efficient and clean. His subs are dedicated to completing the project. Tony not only completed the work but provided feedback on what would have best resale value or what would provide the best cohesive look, while remaining respectful of my specific design and taste. I wholeheartedly recommend him for any project large or small."</p>

                    <p class="card-text">"This is just one of many, MANY projects Tony has done for me. I've known Tony for close to 15 years now. He is THE BEST. You will never go wrong hiring him. He takes pride in his work and will guarantee that you are happy with the end results. Over the years I've owned 4 homes and Tony has done projects for all 4 including adding a bathroom to a basement, finishing an unfinished basement, putting new roofs, replacing Belko doors, repairing damage to ceilings and walls, deck work, painting, tile work. The list goes on and on! Whenever my husband and I need any kind of work done, Tony is our first (and only) choice."</p>

                    <p class="card-text">"Tony and his crew did an excellent job on our kitchen. We had a tight time limit for the renovation to be completed and Tony delivered a wonderful kitchen with weeks to spare on the timeline. He was involved with running the show from day 1 and did an excellent job managing the various tradespeople and keeping the project on track. His wealth of knowledge on renovations also helped us make the best kitchen possible. We are thrilled with the result."</p>

I knew this project had to get done but I honestly did not know who to trust. Having a new kitchen has been a dream Of mine and I wanted to get it right. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Tony and his team. He kept me informed every step of the way. Helped me make important decisions. The kitchen is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! What s most important to me is that Tony kept his word. His team showed up when expected, did amazing work extremely professional!!!"</p>

                    <p class="card-text">"Tony is fantastic! He is hands down the best person I've worked with. He took on a complete renovation of our home, which included a large addition on the first and second floor and reworked the entire existing interior. The work was top notch and he delivered on every aspect of our home, which includes a kitchen that looks like it came out of a magazine! It was done very quickly, and was extremely detail oriented. Our dream home came to life due to Tony and his team, and now we have a home that we love which our 3 young kids will grow up in. Tony is also extremely responsive and the customer service is truly great. He is very easy to work with and will work tirelessly to ensure his clients are happy. He's became apart of our family through this process! Tony definitely went above and beyond and I would HIGHLY recommend him to anyone looking to have ANY project completed."</p>

Tony is truly a consummate professional and he will bring his vast construction knowledge and creativity of his craft to your project from Day One all the way through its Completion. ALL Communication through the whole project was phenomenal as Tony would ALWAYS return a call or text promptly and he would immediately answer our questions or alleviate any concerns we had.
